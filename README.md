# NoteKeeper

## Introduction

NoteKeeper is a tutorial/training project designed to demonstrate gRPC implementation. The use of gRPC here is intended to show how it works rather than represent the most efficient implementation for this use case.

## Server Description

The server component handles note storage and retrieval operations. It implements gRPC service definitions to process client requests and manage the backend logic for the application.

## Client Description

The client component provides an interface to interact with the NoteKeeper server. It uses gRPC to communicate with the server, sending requests and receiving responses for note management operations.
